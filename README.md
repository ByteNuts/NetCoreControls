## Features
**- Independent from data source** - you can use any data source you prefer. Just set up a method that returns the data you want to display.

**- Dynamic models allowed** - there is no need to create a model to render data to a control. Just return dynamic from your data method.

**- AJAX Enabled** - all controls use AJAX to communicate with the server and perform their actions.

**- Controls are connected** - you can easily associate a submit button or a filter with more than one control, even with different controls.

**- Subscribe control events or create custom ones** - all controls share the same base events. They also offer some other events related to the control itself. But hey!, if that isn’t enough, you can create your one custom events!


## Available controls

* NccGrid
* NccSelect

Other controls will be available in a near future...
